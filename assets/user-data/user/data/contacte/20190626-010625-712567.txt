missatge: "Good day to you, \r\nMy name is Barrister Gary E. Hamilton, a United State lawyer. I have previously sent you a message regarding a transaction worth ($20,000,000.00 USD (Twenty Million USD Dollars) left by my late client before his tragic death. \r\nI am contacting you once again because after going through your profile, I strongly believe that you will be in a better position to execute this business transaction with me. \r\nPlease if you are interested, I wish to point out that after the transaction I want 10% of this money to be donated among charity organizations while the remaining 90% will be shared equal by the both of us. \r\nThis transaction is 100% risk free; please respond to me as soon as possible for more detailed information. Here is my email:  eric@hamiltonfirm.us \r\nYours Faithfully, \r\nBarrister Gary E. Hamilton"
