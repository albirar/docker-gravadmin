missatge: "I messaged previously about how explainer videos became an absolute must for every website in 2020. Driving relevant traffic to your site is hard enough, you must capture this traffic and engage them! \r\n \r\nAs you know, Google is constantly changing its SEO algorithm. The only thing that has remained consistent is that adding an explainer video increases website rank and most importantly keeps customers on your page for longer, increasing conversions ratios. \r\n \r\nMy team has created thousands of marketing videos including dozens in your field. Simplify your pitch, increase website traffic, and close more business. \r\n \r\nShould I send over some industry-specific samples? \r\n \r\n-- Monica Brown \r\n \r\nEmail: M.Brown@explainthebiz.online \r\nWebsite: http://explainthebiz.online"
